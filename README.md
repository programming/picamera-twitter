# Pi Camera to Twitter
Shoot with your Pi camera and tweet it automatically.

_I am using this on my Raspberry Pi Zero W._

## Get Started

1. Sign up for a [Twitter Developer account][1] and create an application.
2. Install [Twython][2] on your Raspberry Pi.

    ```
    sudo pip3 install twython
    ```
3. Edit _camera.py_ with your own message, API key, API secret key, access token and access token secret.
4. That's it!
